        <h2>Initial years starting 1976</h2>
        <p>
            Ilayaraja, the Maestro, began his career as an independent Music director in 1976 with the blockbuster
            soundtrack of "Annakkili". The album represented a mix of rural folk music with western
            orchestration. It announced the arrival of authentic Tamil country music into Madras' movie screens. There
            was absolutely no holding back the Maestro from this point onwards. Within the next 5 years, he had
            established himself as the numero Uno in Tamil Film Music.

        <h2>The 80s Monopoly</h2>
        <p>
            Ilayaraja had become prolific to the point of scoring over 40 films a year through the 80s. The quantity had
            a quality in itself. He was the first
            choice of all directors - experienced and freshers. He didn't disappoint anybody, even though his directors
            may have. Films like Thangamagan
            represented his standard film - an album full of blockbusters with Disco, Carnatic-classical and rural
            touches all adequately represented. As it turned out, no other musician has been able to match his
            prolificity till date. This was Ilayaraja's era through and through.

        <h2>Competition catches up in 90s, 00s</h2>
        <p>
            The unchallenged territory of Raja ceased to exist with the arrival of newer directors and music directors
            in the 90s. But Raja continued to deliver rich collections year after year for another decade. He remains
            active and brilliantly so. Just that the 80s era turned out to be once in a lifetime not just for him; but
            for Tamil film industry itself. Films like Hey Ram represent the pinnacle of Indian classical
            fusion with Western Orchestrations, though such hits weren't as frequent as in the 80s.
